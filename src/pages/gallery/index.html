            <h3>Why yoga?</h3>
            <p>We may be biased on the subject, but we believe yoga is for everyone. Studies have shown that a regular practice can not only improve the body’s strength, flexibility, and balance, but can actually reduce blood pressure, improve sleep quality,
                and decrease stress levels, to name a few benefits. Healthy alignment teaches the body to function the way it should, which can help you out of the type of pain caused by dysfunctional movement patterns and repetitive poor posture. Plus,
                standing on your hands is a lot of fun. </p>
            <h3>I’m brand new to yoga. Where do I start?</h3>
            <p>It’s best to start in our gentle or basic classes. Our teachers are experienced with students of all abilities and will always give you 1:1 attention. We recommend setting your mat up in the middle of the room, that way you can look around
                at the other students in class and follow their lead. We have everything you need at the studio, and we even offer a special rate to new students: $39 for an entire month of unlimited yoga! That way, you can take all of the classes you
                like and experience different teachers and styles. Once you start to learn the names of the postures, the experience becomes much more natural.</p>
            <h3>What types of classes do you offer at the studio?</h3>
            <p>We offer something for everyone. Our style incorporates elements of alignment yoga, functional movement, and vinyasa flow; all with an emphasis on mindful breathing. Classes range from very gentle to physically rigorous. Basic classes will
                introduce proper form and alignment in the postures, and advanced classes will generally include a strong dynamic flow. Teachers will always offer modifications for beginning and advanced students, but please choose a class that speaks
                to your current level of ability. For more information, see our Class Descriptions page or feel free to contact us.</p>
            <h3>I’m not flexible. Can I still do yoga? </h3>
            <p>Absolutely! If you are feeling intimidated (which is totally normal!) consider starting with our gentle, basic or mixed level classes. All of our knowledgeable teachers will help you find the pose that’s right for your body. With consistent
                practice, your flexibility will improve tremendously! </p>
            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
            <p>Wear clothing that allows you to move freely. Athletic wear or loose-fitting sweats and t-shirts are best. Most women wear athletic pants and tops. Men generally wear athletic shorts (gym shorts or spandex) and t-shirts. Many practitioners
                bring layers, since your body’s temperature will rise during the active portions of class and fall during final relaxation.</p>
            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>We have everything you need. Many practitioners prefer to use their own mats, but we have some at the studio for you to use, free of charge. We provide all of the props (blankets, bolsters, blocks, straps, eye pillows) you may need and offer
                bottled water too. </p>
            <h3>Is there any etiquette I need to know about?</h3>
            <p>Please remove your shoes when you enter the studio. Silence your cell phone and leave it with your belongings in one of our cubbies. If you arrive early to class, you are welcome to relax and chat in our lobby, or set your mat up in the practice
                space and relax. Many students like to unwind or meditate in the minutes before class, so we ask that the practice room remains a quiet space. If you happen to arrive late, that’s okay, but please wait in the lobby until the teacher has
                finished “om” and the class begins to move. Once that’s happened, quietly set up your mat in an open spot. </p>
            <h3>What is Membership? </h3>
            <p>Membership is our most affordable payment option and it comes with perks! For $99/month, you are entitled to unlimited yoga at our studio as well as 10% off any special events or workshops. You also get to bring a guest who is new to the studio
                to any class for free once per quarter. You can freeze your account once per year for a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of one month. We ask that you commit to a minimum of three months of auto-debited membership. After that, you can
                cancel at any time; just call the studio, email nicole@blackbirdyogastudio.com, or let us know in person. </p>
            <h3>Should I register online? </h3>
            <p>We always recommend online registration through MindBody Online. You can set up an account that will allow you to register and pay for classes ahead of time. While it’s pretty unusual to be turned away, some classes (like restorative) have
                limited space available, so it’s best to play it safe and register ahead of time. </p>
            <h3>Do your class cards expire? </h3>
            <p>5 and 10 class cards expire one year from the date of purchase. </p>
            <h3>Do you offer discounts? </h3>
            <p>Yes. We offer a 10% discount on everything (excluding the new student special) for students under 25 and seniors over 65. </p>
            <h3>Where should I park? </h3>
            <p>There is plenty of parking in front of the studio on Terrace St. There is also a lot behind the building. </p>
