      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>Over the past few years I have become more and more obssessed with capturing the world around me. Coming from a family of photographers, I've always been drawn to images of far away landscapes, serene beauty, and sadness. To me, there is nothing better than immersing yourself in a new area and exploring everything this planet has to offer.</p>
      <h2>Web Development &amp; Design</h2>
      <p>For the past four years I have been honing my craft as a front-end web developer, focusing on bringing great user experiences and  ____ for my clients and friends.</p>
      <p>Being able to solve complex problems and display them in understandable &amp; relatable ways helps me convey messages to the world blah blah (gotta fix this up)</p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>I started playing the saxophone in elemtary school and ever since have had a passion for music and music performance.</p>
      <p>Switching to guitar in high school, I truly found the instrument for me. I've been honing my craft for the past 15 years, playing in numerous metal and punk bands in the tri-state area.</p>
      <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>In 2009 I started recording friends bands in the New Brunswick basement scene. This lead me to create <a href="http://onestonerecording.com/" target="_blank">One Stone Recording &amp; Mastering</a> the same year. Ever since I have been helping bands bring their artistic vision to life.</p>
