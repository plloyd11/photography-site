            <h2>The Blackbird Experience</h2>
            <p>We’re so glad you’ve chosen to start your journey with us. At Blackbird Yoga Studio, we strive to create a space that invites you to practice yoga just as you are. </p>
            <p>We offer a broad range of classes to suit students of all levels of ability: from the brand new beginner to the ultra-advanced practitioner. Our yoga honors tradition. We respect yoga’s ancient roots, but we recognize that you are living a
                modern life in a modern body. Our yoga is creative. We will mix up our class content every single time, but we will always emphasize alignment to keep you safe. Our yoga is functional. If it doesn’t help you move better, breathe better,
                and feel better, it’s not for us.</p>

                <p>"The space is beautiful and so peaceful. The flow of the classes is wonderful and constantly challenging while focusing on form and breath work. The studio is very welcoming. I am thrilled that there is finally something this zen in our
                    area. The evening class schedule is also perfect for my schedule and offers the style that I am looking for."</p>

            <p>We are a body-positive studio. We won’t take your picture or force your pose to look a certain way. That’s because we care much more about how the posture makes you feel, rather than how it looks. Our simple goal is for you to leave the studio
                feeling better and more empowered in your body than you did when you walked in. </p>
            <p>We believe that yoga is for everyone, and our hope is to provide services that are not cost-prohibitive. We offer affordable membership, as well as discounts to students in school and senior citizens. </p>

                <p>"The studio is a tranquil sanctuary where all feel welcome. The instructors are knowledgeable and ensure clients are practicing yoga safely. In addition, I like how the classes are differentiated to meet the needs of all practitioners.
                    Finally, the studio is in a very convenient location. Thank you!"</p>
