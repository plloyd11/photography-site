      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>The art of capturing a moment in time has always fascinated me. Coming from a family of photographers, I've always been drawn to images of far away landscapes, serene beauty, and peaceful somber.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years I have become more and more obssessed with documenting the world around me - immersing myself in unique areas and exploring everything this planet has to offer.</p>

        <h2>Web Development &amp; Design</h2>
        <p>For the past four years I have been honing my craft as a front-end web developer, with a focus on delivering clear, tangible user interfaces and delivering the best experience possible for my clients.</p>
        <p>Nothing is better than being able to solve complex problems and display them in a clean, concise and creative way.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>It all began with the alto saxophone in elementary school and ever since I have had a passion for music and performance.</p>
        <p>Switching to guitar in high school, I truly found the instrument for me. I've been obssessed with making guitar-driven music for the past 15 years, playing in numerous metal and punk bands in the tri-state area.</p>
        <h3>Recording</h3>
        <p>In 2009 I started recording friends bands in the New Brunswick basement scene. This lead me to create <a href="http://onestonerecording.com/" target="_blank">One Stone Recording &amp; Mastering</a> the same year. Ever since I have been helping
          bands throughout the tri-state area bring their artistic vision to life.</p>
