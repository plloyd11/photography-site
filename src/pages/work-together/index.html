        <p>"I could not have asked for a better experience than I had with Pete. From conception to completion, he hit every mark. He is versatile as a photographer, and captured the most flattering images of both my studio and my staff. He made the experience
          of taking headshots (something no one wanted to do) comfortable and fun, which is evident in the finished product. My website is clean, user-friendly, and creative. He was open to my suggestions and significantly improved upon them. Even once
          the project was finished, he made himself available for questions, tweaks, and updates. I would recommend Pete to anyone."</p>
